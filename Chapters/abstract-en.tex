In recent years, the rise of data-driven applications has driven the development of decentralized learning frameworks such as Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL), designed to improve data privacy and distribute computational load across multiple devices. However, current FL systems still rely heavily on centralized aggregators, which imposes privacy and efficiency limitations due to the centralized orchestration.. 

This thesis proposes a fully decentralized platform that combines FL and SL methodologies to overcome these challenges. 
Our approach designs a self-managed system for collaborative decentralized machine learning, minimizing human intervention through dynamic delegation protocols and adaptive role assignment mechanisms. Participants can collaboratively train machine learning models in a secure environment, with devices autonomously handling changes in the network, such as device failures and connectivity changes.

Our research contributes to the field of decentralized learning by providing a robust alternative to traditional centralized systems, enabling collaboration and adaptability.
