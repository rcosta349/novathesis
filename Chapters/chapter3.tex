\chapter{Planning}
\label{cha:planning}

This Chapter aims at exemplifying how to do common stuff with \LaTeX. We also show some stuff which is not that common! ;)

Please, use these examples as a starting point, but you should always consider using the \emph{Big Oracle} (aka, \href{http://www.google.com}{Google}, your best friend) to search for additional information or al-ternative ways for achieving similar results.

% \subsection{Inserting Figures Wrapped with text} % (fold)
% \label{ssec:inserting_images_wrapped_with_text}
%
% You should only use this feature is \emph{really} necessary. This means, you have a very small image, that will look lonely just with text above and below.
%
% In this case, you must use the \verb!wrapfigure! package.  To use \verb!wrapfig!, you must first add this to the preamble:
%
% \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{2.5cm}
%   \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=2cm]{snowman-vectorial}
%   \caption{A snow-man}
% \end{wrapfigure}
%
% \noindent\verb!\usepackage{wrapfig}!\\
% This then gives you access to:\\
% \verb!\begin{wrapfigure}[lineheight]{alignment}{width}!\\
% Alignment can normally be either ``l'' for left, or ``r'' for right. Lowercase ``l'' or ``r'' forces the figure to start precisely where specified (and may cause it to run over page breaks), while capital ``L'' or ``R'' allows the figure to float. If you defined your document as twosided, the alignment can also be ``i'' for inside or ``o'' for outside, as well as ``I'' or ``O''. The width is obviously the width of the figure. The example above was introduced with:
% \lstset{language=TeX, morekeywords={\begin,\includegraphics,\caption}, caption=Wrapfig Example, label=lst:latex_example}
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{2.5cm}
%     \centering
%       \includegraphics[width=2cm]{snowman-vectorial}
%     \caption{A snow-man}
%   \end{wrapfigure}
% \end{lstlisting}
